# Things to do

* ~~Add the decode process~~
* ~~Improve the sector mode detection, to detect all known CD-ROM/CDDA sectors~~
* ~~Add buffered output to write in chunks and speed up the process~~
* ~~Try to use mmap instead manual buffers to see if works faster.~~ Using FILE buffers.
* ~~Add options to compress the stream directly instead to have to use external programs~~ For now zlib.
* ~~Convert the program into a library to make it usable by another programs (for now is a class).~~ Doesn't worth. A class is enougth to be used in another programs.
* ~~Try to detect and compress CDDA tracks using FLAC, APE, or similar.~~
* Verify that all CD-ROM modes are working (For now only CDDA, Mode 2 and Mode 2 XA 1 were tested)
* ~~Add a sumary about the sectors types processed and sizes~~
